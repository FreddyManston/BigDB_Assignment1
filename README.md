# BigDB_Assignment1

1) See BigDBAss1.txt on how to initialise the databse.
2) mongorc.js defines all the functions that can be used in the database. Don't forget to place it in your home directory (your username root folder)
3) to use Main.java, an IDE was used with the mongo driver as a dependency
